# NeuroAI Lab
Collection of code related to my graduate research in the field of neuroAI under Eli Shlizerman and Eric-Shea Brown at University of Washington. 

# resonate_and_fire
Code related to training and working with the resonate-and-fire (RF) neuronal model introduced by Izhikevich. It is my belief that the multiplexing ability of RF neurons could be utilized to enable more powerful training than vanilla SNN models using the leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model.

# bnn_snn_training 
Code related to training BNNs (biophysical neural networks) and SNNs (spiking neural networks) on a variety of tasks. Pretty unorganized at the moment. The main code to generate figures is in figures.py.
